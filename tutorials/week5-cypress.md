# UI Testing with Cypress

This tutorial covers the basic concepts of UI testing and end-to-end (E2E) testing using Cypress. By the end, you’ll have a clear understanding of UI testing, how it compares with other forms of testing, and how to implement Cypress for UI testing with practical examples.


## Demo Project for Practice
Before we dive into the details, you can download and set up a demo project that will help you understand Cypress testing better. This project will provide a hands-on environment where you can explore different scenarios and practice writing Cypress tests.

### 1. Download the Cypress Demo Project
Download the Cypress demo project from the link below.

[Cypress Demo](./assets/week5-cypress/cypress-demo.zip)
### 2. Install Dependencies

After downloading and extracting the ZIP file, navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies using npm:

```bash
cd cypress-demo
npm install
```

### 3. Open Cypress

Once the dependencies are installed, open Cypress using the following command:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

## What is UI Testing?

UI (User Interface) testing involves testing the graphical interface of an application to ensure that it behaves as expected. This includes checking how elements like buttons, forms, and text fields respond to user actions. UI testing is an important part of maintaining quality in software, as it ensures users can interact with the application seamlessly.

### UI Testing vs. E2E Testing

UI testing focuses specifically on the frontend (how a user interacts with the application), while **End-to-End (E2E)** testing tests the entire flow of an application—from the frontend to the backend, database, and external systems. 

| Feature              | UI Testing                              | End-to-End Testing                     |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Focus**            | Testing user interface and interactions | Testing the full user journey          |
| **Components Tested**| Frontend only                           | Frontend, backend, database, APIs      |
| **Tools**            | Cypress, Selenium, Puppeteer            | Cypress, Playwright                    |
| **Use Cases**        | Testing individual elements or flows    | Ensuring the entire app works as a whole|

### Example Scenarios


Here are some scenarios where UI testing is typically used:

- Testing a login form to ensure it behaves as expected when correct/incorrect credentials are provided.
- Checking that a search feature returns the expected results.
- Testing whether the user is able to submit a form successfully and gets proper feedback.

## Using Cypress for UI Testing

Cypress is a popular framework for writing automated tests for web applications. It is particularly good at UI and E2E testing due to its ability to interact directly with the browser in real-time.

### Setting Up Cypress

To get started with Cypress, follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Project**

   First, create a new directory for your project:

   ```bash
   mkdir cypress-tutorial
   cd cypress-tutorial
   ```

2. **Initialize the Project**
    Initialize the project and install Cypress by running:

    ```bash
    npm init -y
    npm install cypress --save-dev
    ```

3. **Open Cypress**
    Once installed, you can open Cypress using the following command:
    ```bash
    npx cypress open
    ```
    Cypress will open a test runner window, where you can create and run tests.



### Common Commands

Here are some common commands you'll use frequently when writing UI tests in Cypress:

| Command               | Description                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `cy.visit(url)`        | Visits a specific URL                                       |
| `cy.get(selector)`     | Grabs an element based on a CSS selector                    |
| `cy.contains(text)`    | Finds an element that contains the specified text           |
| `cy.click()`           | Clicks on an element                                        |
| `cy.type(text)`        | Types into an input field                                   |
| `cy.should(condition)` | Asserts that an element meets a certain condition           |


## Example Scenarios and Tests
Here are a few scenarios that show how Cypress can be used for UI testing:

### UI Testing Scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Testing a Login Form
This test checks if the login form functions as expected when correct and incorrect credentials are submitted.

```typescript
describe('Login Form', () => {
  it('Should show error for incorrect credentials', () => {
    cy.visit('/login');
    cy.get('input[name="email"]').type('wrong@example.com');
    cy.get('input[name="password"]').type('wrongpassword');
    cy.get('button[type="submit"]').click();
    cy.contains('Invalid credentials').should('be.visible');
  });

  it('Should successfully login with correct credentials', () => {
    cy.visit('/login');
    cy.get('input[name="email"]').type('user@example.com');
    cy.get('input[name="password"]').type('correctpassword');
    cy.get('button[type="submit"]').click();
    cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard');
  });
});
```

#### Scenario 2: Testing a Search Feature
This test verifies that searching for a keyword returns the correct results.
```typescript
describe('Search Feature', () => {
  it('Should display search results when a keyword is entered', () => {
    cy.visit('/search');
    cy.get('input[name="search"]').type('Cypress');
    cy.get('button[type="submit"]').click();
    cy.contains('Search Results for Cypress').should('be.visible');
    cy.get('.result-item').should('have.length.greaterThan', 0);
  });
});
```

#### Scenario 3: Form Submission and Validation
In this scenario, we check if a form validates input and submits correctly.

```typescript
describe('Form Submission', () => {
  it('Should display validation errors for empty fields', () => {
    cy.visit('/form');
    cy.get('button[type="submit"]').click();
    cy.contains('This field is required').should('be.visible');
  });

  it('Should submit the form when all fields are filled', () => {
    cy.visit('/form');
    cy.get('input[name="name"]').type('John Doe');
    cy.get('input[name="email"]').type('john@example.com');
    cy.get('input[name="phone"]').type('1234567890');
    cy.get('button[type="submit"]').click();
    cy.contains('Form submitted successfully').should('be.visible');
  });
});
```


### E2E Testing Scenarios:
E2E tests are typically used to validate the entire flow of an application, including frontend, backend, and external systems.

## Where to Place Cypress Tests
Here is the typical structure of a Cypress project:

### 1. Cypress Folder Structure: 
After running npx cypress open, Cypress will create a folder structure like this:
```bash
cypress/
├── e2e/          # Your test files go here
├── fixtures/     # Test data (JSON files) for mocking server responses
├── support/      # Reusable commands and hooks
└── cypress.config.js  # Cypress configuration file
```

### 2. Create Test Files:
Inside the cypress/e2e directory, create separate test files for each feature you want to test. For example:
```bash
cypress/
├── e2e/
│   ├── login.cy.ts           # Login tests
│   ├── search.cy.ts          # Search tests
│   ├── formSubmission.cy.ts  # Form submission tests
```

### 3. Adding describe Blocks:
Each test file should contain one or more describe blocks, which group related tests. These blocks and individual it blocks go inside the respective test files.

Example:
```bash
// cypress/e2e/login.cy.ts
describe('Login Form', () => {
  // individual tests inside 'it' blocks
});
```

### 4. Running Tests:
You can run all tests either through the Cypress Test Runner or in headless mode with:
```bash
npx cypress run
```
