## Introduction to API Requests and Postman

**APIs** (Application Programming Interfaces) are essential tools that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. As developers, it's crucial to understand how to interact with APIs, which involves making API requests. API requests are structured interactions where one software sends a request to retrieve or send data to another.

**Postman** is a popular API testing tool that allows developers to build, test, and modify APIs quickly and easily. It provides an interface to interact with APIs and simplifies API development. Postman supports making requests like **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, **DELETE**, and more.

With this guide, you can:
- **Understand the basics of API requests**, including the different types (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **Learn how to use Postman** to send requests and test APIs.
- **Test API responses** to ensure that they return the expected results.

### Types of API Requests:
- **GET**: Retrieves data from an API. It's commonly used when you want to fetch information without making any changes.
  - *Example*: Use a GET request to retrieve a list of videos related to the one you're currently watching on a streaming platform (e.g., `GET /videos/related`).
  
- **POST**: Submits new data to an API to create a resource. It's used when you need to send data to the server to create something new.
  - *Example*: Use a POST request to save a newly uploaded video on a platform (e.g., `POST /videos`).
  
- **PUT**: Updates an existing resource on the API. It's used when you want to modify an existing item or data.
  - *Example*: Use a PUT request to update the details of an existing video, like changing its title or description (e.g., `PUT /videos/{id}`).
  
- **DELETE**: Removes a resource from an API. It's used when you need to delete something from the server.
  - *Example*: Use a DELETE request to remove a video you've uploaded from the platform (e.g., `DELETE /videos/{id}`).

Additional HTTP Methods:
- PATCH: Partial updates to resources
- HEAD: Get headers only (no body)
- OPTIONS: Check what methods are allowed

Each of these request types serves a specific purpose in API interactions, and Postman allows you to easily switch between them to test and build your APIs.

## Breakdown of an API Request

Each API request has key components:

### 1. URL
For this URL -> `https://localhost:8000/api/users`

The URL defines the location of the API you're interacting with:
- **Protocol** (`https://`)
- **Domain** (`localhost`)
- **Port** (`8000`)
- **Endpoint** (`/api/users`)

### 2. Method
Defines the action type:
- **GET**: Retrieves data
- **POST**: Submits new data
- **PUT**: Updates data
- **DELETE**: Deletes data

### 3. Parameters (GET) vs. Body (POST)
- **GET** sends data as **query parameters** in the URL:
https://api.example.com/users?age=25
In this example, `age=25` is a query parameter used to filter 25 year old users from the list of users.

- **POST** sends data in the **body** (usually JSON). In this example, username and password entered by the user is getting sent to the server for log in.
```json
{
    "username": "user",
    "password": "password"
}
```

### 4. Headers
Headers provide additional information about the request or the client making it. They help the server understand the request. Some common headers include:

- **Content-Type**: Specifies the format of the request body (e.g., `application/json` for JSON data).
- **Authorization**: Contains credentials like [API keys](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/api-key) or [tokens](https://www.okta.com/identity-101/what-is-token-based-authentication/) required to access certain endpoints.
  - *Example*:
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <your-api-token>
    ```

- **Accept**: Specifies the format in which the client expects the server to return the response (e.g., `application/json`).
  - *Example*:
    ```
    Accept: application/json
    ```

### 5. Response
After the server processes the request, it sends back a **response**. The response typically includes:

- **Status Code**: A number indicating the result of the request.
  - Common status codes:
    - `200 OK`: The request was successful.
    - `201 Created`: The resource was successfully created (used for POST requests).
    - `400 Bad Request`: There was an error in the request.
    - `404 Not Found`: The resource could not be found.
    - `500 Internal Server Error`: An error occurred on the server.

- **Response Body**: Contains the data returned by the API, usually in JSON format. For example, when creating a new user, the server might return the new user data as response like this:
  ```json
  {
      "id": 1,
      "username": "newuser",
      "email": "newuser@example.com"
  }
  ```
## Authentication in APIs
Common Authentication Methods
1. API Key Authentication
```
Headers:
X-API-Key: your-api-key-here
```
2. Bearer Token (JWT)
```
Headers:
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```
3. Basic Authentication
```
Headers:
Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)
```
4. OAuth 2.0
More complex flow involving authorization servers and access tokens.

### Additional things to note:
- See this [Mozilla documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) for further information on status codes.
- It is good practice to use [environment variables](https://medium.com/chingu/an-introduction-to-environment-variables-and-how-to-use-them-f602f66d15fa) to store sensitive data or data repeatedly used, such as domain names, tokens, or credentials. 
- [Request/Response validation](https://medium.com/@theqachronicles/validating-api-responses-8ee9df01ef26) helps ensure every API request and response are following the expected format with expected values.
- See this [Postman documentation](https://blog.postman.com/best-practices-for-api-error-handling/) for implementing comprehensive error handling on server-side.
- You can also use [cURL commands](https://curl.se/docs/tutorial.html) to transfer data with URLs through command line.

To send a POST request you need to enter the URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/question/addQuestion`) and include the Body as well.
- Go to the **Body** tab.
- Select **raw**.
- Choose **JSON** as the format.
- Enter the JSON data in this format:
```json
{
    "title": "How do I use Postman?",
    "text": "I am trying to build an API using TypeScript, but I'm unable to test using Postman. How do I do this?",
    "tags": [
        {
            "name": "Postman",
            "description": "API testing tool that allows developers to send HTTP requests."
        }
    ],
    "asked_by": "Pavan Kumar",
    "ask_date_time": "2024-10-08T12:00:00.000Z",
    "answers": [],
    "views": 0,
    "up_votes": [],
    "down_votes": []
}
```

3. Click the **Send** button and wait for the response.

### Step 3: View the Response
- After clicking "Send," Postman will display the API response below the request window.
- You will see the **Status Code**, **Response Body**, **Headers**, and **Cookies** (if applicable).

## Setting Up Authentication in Postman

- Go to the Authorization tab in your request
- Select authentication type from dropdown
- Enter credentials
- Postman automatically adds appropriate headers

## Setting up environment Variables in Postman

- Click the gear icon (⚙️) in top right
- Select "Manage Environments"
- Click "Add" to create new environment
- Add variables. For example,
```
Variable: base_url
Initial Value: http://localhost:8000
Current Value: http://localhost:8000

Variable: api_token
Initial Value: your-dev-token
Current Value: your-dev-token
```

Using environment variables:
- In your requests, use double curly braces:
```
URL: {{base_url}}/api/users
Headers: Authorization: Bearer {{api_token}}
```

## Saving API Requests and Using History

One of Postman's key features is the ability to **save API requests** for future use. This can save you time when testing or working on multiple endpoints. Additionally, Postman keeps track of your request history, allowing you to quickly revisit previous requests without re-entering all the details.

To learn more about using Postman's history, visit: [Postman History](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/basics/navigating-postman/#history).

## Organizing Requests into Collections

Postman also allows you to save and organize requests into **collections**. A collection is essentially a folder where you can store multiple requests, making it easier to manage large projects and share API workflows with your team.

For more information on creating and using collections, refer to the Postman documentation: [Postman Collections](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/intro-to-collections/).

These features enhance your ability to efficiently manage, organize, and track your API development process within Postman.


## Recommended Tools

In addition to using the Postman desktop app, you can also integrate Postman with Visual Studio Code through the Postman extension. This extension allows you to send API requests directly from your code editor. 

You can find the extension and its documentation here: [Postman VS Code Extension](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/basics/about-vs-code-extension/).
