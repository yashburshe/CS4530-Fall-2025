On behalf of the entire [instructional team](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Fall-2025/staff) (all 3 instructors and 20 TAs), welcome to the Fall 2025 edition of CS 4530! [This website](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Fall-2025/) will contain all of the lectures, assignments and tutorials for the class. Our [Canvas site](https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/225864) contains your gradebook as well as single-sign-on links to Piazza (for questions and discussion), instructions for submitting assignments and replicates much of the material from the class website.

In advance of the first week of class, we've shared the [calendars for each section](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Fall-2025/calendar/), the first two lectures (with related activities), and tutorials on installing your IDE, Typescript, Unit testing with Jest, MongoDB and API Requests. 

The first individual project deliverable will be available soon (no later than Friday). We will send another announcement when it is published.

The schedule of office hours is now posted on the staff page. We will start holding office hours from Thursday Sep 4th. We have 80 hours of scheduled TA office hours per week.

Zoom link for the online section (Section 9) can be found on Canvas -> Zoom Meetings.

We are looking forward to meeting you all this week!
