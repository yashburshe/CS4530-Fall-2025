The [second and (final!) individual project deliverable](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Fall-2025/assignments/ip2) is now released, and will be due on Wednesday, Oct 15 at 12pm (noon) ET. We strongly encourage you to read through the assignment soon, so that you can begin to formulate a plan of attack to complete this assignment.

Also, please complete this [Team Formation Survey](https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/225864/assignments/2856277) to help us organize you into a team for the term project. EVERY STUDENT must fill this form out by Wednesday 9/24, or risk being placed in a random team. **Please fill out the form even if you don't have preference for team members.** 

We would recommend that you check with other students in your section before filling out the survey.
