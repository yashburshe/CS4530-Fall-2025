We have posted the instructions for setting up your team repository. You can find them in the start of the [CI/CD Pipeline Activity]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link Activities/Module13 Activity.md %}). The repository will include the starter code for the final project. We recommend that you start this process as soon as possible to avoid any delays. Canvas assignment for this activity will be published soon.
