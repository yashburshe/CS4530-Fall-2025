## Activity: Understanding STRIDE

The STRIDE framework is useful to reason about potential threats in a threat modeling session. STRIDE is an acronym that stands for six different threat categories -- spoofing (S), tampering (T), Repudiation (R), Information Disclosure (I), Denial of Service (D), and Escalation of Privilege (E). 

### Steps
