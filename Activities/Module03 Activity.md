## Test Adequacy Activity
We will gain experience improving test suites using two adequacy criteria: line coverage and mutation coverage. The instructions reference line numbers in transcriptManager.ts. Do *not* change that file while you are following along, or else you may find that the line referenced do not match what you see.

As usual, download the [starter code]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link Activities/module03-test-adequacy.zip %}) and run `npm install`.

Please write tests so that lines 91 and 110 are covered. Also, examine remaining mutants that are either survived or not detected and write tests that will detect & kill them. Put all your new tests in a file `newTests.test.ts`. When you are done, submit that file only

Be sure to review the canvas assignment for submission and other related details (if assigned).
