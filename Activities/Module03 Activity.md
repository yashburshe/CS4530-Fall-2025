## Test Adequacy Activity
We will gain experience improving test suites using two adequacy criteria: line coverage and mutation coverage. The instructions reference line numbers in transcriptManager.ts. Do *not* change that file while you are following along, or else you may find that the line referenced do not match what you see.

As usual, download the [starter code]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link Activities/module03-test-adequacy.zip %}) and run `npm install`.

Please write tests so that lines 76, 85, 95 are covered. Also, examine remaining mutants that are not detected and write tests that will detect them. Put all your new tests in a file `newTests.test.ts`. When you are done, submit that file only.

Be sure to review the canvas assignment for submission and other related details (if assigned).
